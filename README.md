# ultimate-multicurl
i figured out how to make multi-curl work with multiple callbacks

  this is a mix of multicurl from 
    http://multicurl.nisu.org/ and 
    https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_cURL
    
    
to use this with fat free frame work- https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree - put multicurl.php in your fatfree/lib folder

there is a really nice proxy grabber as well (comes in handy for just about any web scraping project)

the example is in brainy_scrape.php ( multicurl web scraper with proxies - recover on bad page load - multiple callbacks)

you can use the multi-curl object without fatfreeframework
